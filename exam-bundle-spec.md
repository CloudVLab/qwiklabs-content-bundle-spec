# Qwiklabs Exam Bundle Specification

**Version 1**

> This is a DRAFT document. We welcome feedback as this format evolves.

## `qwiklabs.yaml` Structure

Here's a sample `qwiklabs.yaml` file with all nested details removed to make it easier to see the general file structure.

```yml
entity_type: Exam
schema_version: 1

passing_percentage: 67
default_locale: en
duration: 120

title: 
  locales:
    en: My Excellent Exam

forms: ...
```

Note that all of the localized content (stem, option titles, etc) are HTML content that may be displayed in various contexts. All of these chunks will be sanitized according to the restricted set in the [HTML spec](./html-spec.md).

### Exam attributes

attribute          | required | type       | notes
-------------------| -------- | ---------- | -----------------------------------------
default_locale     | ✓        | string     | Corresponds to the locale that the exam is authored in. Authoring tools can use this as a hint to notify localizers when content in the default locale is updated. Also, it provides a hint to the learner interface about which locale to display if an instruction/resource is not localized for the learner's current locale.
schema_version     | ✓        | integer    | Which version of the exam bundle schema you are using
title              | ✓        | dictionary | A locale dictionary of the exam title, such as "My Excellent Exam"
passing_percentage | ✓        | integer    | The threshold grade that a student needs to achieve in order to count as "passing" the exam.
duration           | ✓        | integer    | The maximum time a student is allotted for the exam, in minutes.
forms              | ✓        | array      | An array of paths to `form` (see below for details) files in the bundle.
randomize_items    |          | boolean    | Whether `items` in `forms` should be presented in a random order; `true` by default
randomize_options  |          | boolean    | Whether `options` in `items` should be presented in a random order; `true` by default

### Forms
Forms are versions of an exam. An exam may have multiple forms (i.e. A and B), where A and B will have a different collection of items. One student taking an exam may get form A, and another form B, but both students are considered to be taking "equivalent" exams. YAML is the required format for stored forms.

```yml
forms:
  - forms/formA.yaml
  - forms/formB.yaml
  - forms/formC.yaml
```

#### `formX.yaml` Structure

Here's a sample `formX.yaml` file with all nested details removed to make it easier to see the general file structure.

```yml
items: ...
```

attribute          | required | type       | notes
-------------------| -------- | ---------- | -----------------------------------------
items              | ✓        | array      | An ordered array of `items` (see below for details) in this form - items will appear to students in this order


### Items
Items are polymorphic - i.e. there are several different _item types_ that are defined slightly differently. `items` is an array of dictionaries with appropriate attributes for the given `type`. The allowed values for `type` are:
- `multiple-choice`
- `multiple-select`
- `match`

#### multiple-choice Items

An exam item that has multiple options and one answer. One option is the _answer_, and the rest are _distractors_. There must be exactly one answer.

attribute | required | type       | notes
----------| -------- | -----------| -----------------------------------------
id        | ✓        | string     | A unique identifier for this item
type      | ✓        | string     | The item type, which is always `multiple-choice`
client_code | ✓      | string     | A unique identifier for this item generated by and for the item author
stem      | ✓        | dictionary | A locale dictionary of the text that asks the question, such as "Which of the following is a color?"
options   | ✓        | array      | An array of `options` (see below for details); order does not matter
section   |          | string     | The section the item belongs to, such as "Networking"; used to group the item with related items
seed      |          | boolean    | `true` if this item is not to be graded; `false` by default
rationale |          | dictionary | A locale dictionary for an explanation of and/or any references to the question answer(s)

#### multiple-select Items

An exam item that has multiple options, any number of which are answers. Correct options are _answers_, and incorrect options are _distractors_.

attribute | required | type       | notes
----------| -------- | -----------| -----------------------------------------
id        | ✓        | string     | A unique identifier for this item
type      | ✓        | string     | The item type, which is always `multiple-select`
client_code | ✓      | string     | A unique identifier for this item generated by and for the item author
stem      | ✓        | dictionary | A locale dictionary for the text that asks the question, such as "Which of the following is a color?"
options   | ✓        | array      | An array of `options` (see below for details); order does not matter
section   |          | string     | The section the item belongs to, such as "Networking"; used to group the item with related items
seed      |          | boolean    | `true` if this item is not to be graded; `false` by default
rationale |          | dictionary | A locale dictionary for an explanation of and/or any references to the question answer(s)

#### match Items

An exam item that has multiple stems with a "lead in" prompt. The correct option for each matching stem is directly specified as the answer. A matching item will be scored based on correctly matching all the stems.

attribute | required | type       | notes
----------| -------- | -----------| -----------------------------------------
id        | ✓        | string     | A unique identifier for this item
type      | ✓        | string     | The item type, which is always `match`
client_code | ✓      | string     | A unique identifier for this item generated by and for the item author
lead_in      | ✓        | dictionary | 	A locale dictionary of text that provides a lead-in, such as "Can You Match the Capital City to the Correct US State?"
stems     | ✓        | array      | An array of `stems` (see below for details); order does not matter
options   | ✓        | array      | An array of `options` (see below for details); order does not matter
section   |          | string     | The section the item belongs to, such as "Networking"; used to group the item with related items
seed      |          | boolean    | `true` if this item is not to be graded; `false` by default
rationale |          | dictionary | A locale dictionary for an explanation of and/or any references to the question answer(s)

#### match Stems

Match items need an additional `stems` array which contains all of the question(s) for which the user must provide a matching answer.

attribute    | required | type       | notes
-------------| -------- | -----------| -----------------------------------------
id        | ✓        | string     | A unique ID for this match Stem
title     | ✓        | dictionary | A locale dictionary for the content of this stem, such as "Springfield"
answer    | ✓        | string    | ID for option that is the answer for this stem


### Option

`multiple-choice` and `multiple-select`, and `match` items all have an `options` array which contains all of the answer(s) and distractors that the user may choose from. Options are defined for both item types below:

attribute    | required | type       | notes
-------------| -------- | -----------| -----------------------------------------
id        | ✓        | string     | A unique ID for this Option
title     | ✓        | dictionary | A locale dictionary for the content of this option, such as "Blue"
is_answer | ✓        | boolean    | `true` if this option is an answer, and `false` if it is a distractor (not used for `match` type)
