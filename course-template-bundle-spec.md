modules                 | ✓        | array       | See below

### Modules

The meat of a `CourseTemplate` is an ordered list of modules, each of which is a collection of steps, defining what a learner needs to do to complete the course. A module has a `title`, `description`, and array of `steps`. The full specification is as follows:

attribute               | required | type        | notes
----------------------- | -------- | ----------- | -----------------------------------------
id                      | ✓        | string      | A unique identifier for this module
title                   | ✓        | dictionary  | A locale dictionary of titles
description             |          | dictionary  | A locale dictionary of descriptions
steps                   | ✓        | array       | See below

### Resources

While heavyweight activities like labs and quizzes must be defined elsewhere in the library, we allow simpler resources to be specified directly in `qwiklabs.yaml`. They can then be referenced in the `steps` just like labs and quizzes.

For details on how to specify resources, see the [Resource Spec](./resource-spec.md).

### Steps

A step consists of a set of one or more activity options, along with some metadata. Valid activity types are:

* `lab`
* `quiz`
* `resource`

`lab` and `quiz` will reference content defined elsewhere in the library, and `resource` will reference content defined elsewhere in the same `qwiklabs.yaml` file.

The overall format should look like:

```yml
steps:
  - id: overview-video
    activity_options:
    - type: resource
      id: intro-video
    prompt:
      locales:
        en: If you've never used GCP, we recommend this overview video.
    optional: true

  - id: intro-lab
    activity_options:
    - type: lab
      id: intro-to-gcp

  - id: choosing-compute
    activity_options:
    - type: resource
      id: choosing-compute

  - id: learn-compute
    activity_options:
    - type: lab
      id: intro-to-appengine-python
    - type: lab
      id: intro-to-kubernetes-engine
    - type: lab
      id: intro-to-cloud-functions
    prompt:
      locales:
        en: Learn more about one of these common compute resources.

  - id: compute-quiz
    activity_options:
    - type: quiz
      id: compute-quiz
```

The order in which steps are listed defines the order they will be displayed. When a step has multiple options, the learner will be expected to do exactly one of the activities.

The full specification for a step is as follows:

attribute        | required | type        | notes
---------------- | -------- | ----------- | -----------------------------------------
id               | ✓        | string      | A unique identifier for this step
activity_options | ✓        | array       | `activity_options` is an array of dictionaries with the format:
-- type          | ✓        | enum        | One of `lab`, `quiz`, `resource`
-- id            | ✓        | string      | Reference to the unique identifier for the activity - `library/slug`.
prompt           |          | dictionary  | Key is `locales` and each locale is a dictionary mapping locale codes to a prompt describing the step
optional         |          | boolean     | `true` if the step is *not* required for completion
