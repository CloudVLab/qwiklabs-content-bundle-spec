# Qwiklabs ClassroomTemplate Bundle Specification

**Version 1**

> **Note: For Interim Use Only**
>
> This specification is for existing Qwiklabs platform users that are currently using the `ClassroomTemplate` model. It should be used to help transition from `ClassroomTemplates` to [`CourseTemplates`](./course-template-bundle-spec.md). If you are not currently using `ClassroomTemplates`, please use `CourseTemplates` instead.

### Modules

A `ClassroomTemplate` presents labs to the learner in a specific order. To keep some compatibilty with other "bundle entities" we will use a simple collection of steps, each with one lab activity.

attribute               | required | type        | notes
----------------------- | -------- | ----------- | -----------------------------------------
id                      | ✓        | string      | A unique identifier for this module
steps                   |          | array       | See below

### Steps

For a ClassroomTemplate, a step consists of one activity option. The valid activity type is:

* `lab`

Where `lab` references content defined elsewhere in the library.

The overall format should look like:

```yml
steps:
  - id: intro-lab
    activity_options:
    - type: lab
      id: intro-to-gcp

  - id: learn-compute
    activity_options:
    - type: lab
      id: intro-to-appengine-python
```

The order in which steps are listed defines the order they will be displayed.
